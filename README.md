# ip2location
This is a short little project I coded to get more familiar with python. I also wanted something like this to get userbase statistics. Obviously, once you get in you can see this isn't an optimized large scale calculator, but rather a small project I worked on for 45 minutes. If you would like to give any feedback I would be glad to hear it!
